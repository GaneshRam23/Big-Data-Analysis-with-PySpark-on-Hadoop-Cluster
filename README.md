# 🎬 Big Data Movie Review Analysis on GCP with PySpark 📊

In this project, I leveraged the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and PySpark to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a movie review dataset. This endeavor showcases my proficiency in handling large-scale data processing and analytics, demonstrating the application of cutting-edge technologies in the realm of big data.

Key Highlights:

🔍 Data Exploration and Preparation: Utilized PySpark's distributed processing capabilities to efficiently explore and prepare the movie review dataset for analysis, ensuring scalability and performance.

🚀 GCP Integration: Seamlessly integrated Google Cloud Platform services, including Google Dataproc and Hadoop, to store and manage the vast amount of data. Leveraged GCP's infrastructure for parallel processing, enabling faster and more efficient computations.
